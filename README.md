PyMC3 approach to the bimbo challenge.

## Setup

You'll need to run the helpers.py script, to prepare the
database, then copy that database to /tmp

I'm doing it this way for a couple of reasons:

1. This way I can re-name all the columns to english
2. I can add in a rand column for splitting and minibatching

So just run the thing and copy the database, and you 
should be good to go.
